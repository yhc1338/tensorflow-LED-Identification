# tensorflow-LED-Identification
This code is used to identificate the LED's states.
This code copy from http://www.tensorfly.cn/.
It was used to identificate MNIST.
The aim of the code is finding the way to change the data sets.I want to use my own data sets.
you can change the structure of the CNN to improve the speed.but it will cut down the accuracy.So you should increase the epoch.It is common.I write this nonsense words only for learning English.hahahaha
